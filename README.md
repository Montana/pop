# PoPPy
I've coded this so by using the page object model we can make non-brittle test code and reduce or eliminate duplicate test code, in automation. Beside of that it improves the readability and allows us to create interactive documentation. Last but not least, we can create tests with less keystroke. An implementation of the page object model can be achieved by separating the abstraction of the test object and the test scripts.
